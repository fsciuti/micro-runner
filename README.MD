## Micro-Runner
The main aim behind [Micro-Runner](https://github.com/lucamezzalira/micro-runner/blob/master/micro-runner/README.md) is making micro benchmarking accessible and useful.    
Often, web, mobile or desktop applications are suffering from poor performances and developers are struggling to analyze the performance of their applications and improve them.      
Micro-Runner aims to run some code in isolation like you would do in a playground providing immediate feedback in your CLI when you want to compare the most performant implementation across multiple of them.

## Micro-Runner-Metrics
[Micro-Runner-Metrics](https://github.com/lucamezzalira/micro-runner/blob/master/micro-runner-metrics/README.md) is the library used by Micro-Runner CLI for gathering metrics.
