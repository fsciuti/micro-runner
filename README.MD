# Micro-Runner
### a CLI playground for benchmarking your JavaScript code

## Micro-Runner
The main aim behind [Micro-Runner](https://github.com/lucamezzalira/micro-runner/blob/master/micro-runner/README.md) is making microbenchmarking accessible and useful.    
Often, web, mobile or desktop applications are suffering of poor performances and developers are struggling to analyze their applications performance and improve them.
Micro-Runner aims to run some code in isolation like you would do in a  playground, directly from your CLI, providing an immediate feedback when you want to compare the most performant implementation across multiple of them.

## Micro-Runner-Metrics
[Micro-Runner-Metrics](https://github.com/lucamezzalira/micro-runner/blob/master/micro-runner-metrics/README.md) is the library used by Micro-Runner CLI for gathering and parsing metrics.

### Roadmap
[x] create JavaScript library for gathering and reporting metrics to Micro-Runner   
[] better errors management    
[] add _interactive help_ in the CLI     
[] gathering micro benchmarks from existing applications
